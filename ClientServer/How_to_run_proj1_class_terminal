How to run .class files for Proj 1, Network:

***THIS PROGRAM CHUNKS INTO SIZE 100KB CHUNKS AND IS FOR 5 CLIENTS ONLY! HARDCODED!
USE NUMBERS 0-4 FOR CLIENT NUMBERS AND NOT 1..5!***

Download:
1)Server.class
2)Client.class
3)Handler.class
4)Client$GetSocketTask.class
5)network.config

Create a folder called “torrent” and house files inside.

Open up terminal in the parent director of “torrent”
Ex:
localhost:Working_Versions gonsalves-admin$ ls
network.config	p2p.jar		p2p_debug.jar	torrent

(I believe network.config could be in either “torrent” or the parent to “torrent”)

Run the server:
localhost:Working_Versions gonsalves-admin$ java torrent.Server
Created by: Drew Gonsalves
Enter full path to file: 
/Users/gonsalves-admin/Documents/School/CNT5106C-Network/Proj1/Strang.pdf

Run (5) Clients (***CLIENTS ARE NUMBERED 0-4):
localhost:Working_Versions gonsalves-admin$ java torrent.Client
Enter Peer Number (0..N-1): 
0

Close the clients - they close automatically

Close the server - either in Activity Console OR use ‘ctrl+c’ or else you will get socket error if attempting to run program again because socket is still in use.

Files are saved at (Hardcoded): 
Combined chunks in Peer 0 to form file Strang.pdf in /Users/gonsalves-admin/Documents/School/CNT5106C-Network/Proj1/torrent_tmp
